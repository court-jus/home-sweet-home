Setup
Each player takes 1 individual board and 3 workers.
Shuffle all the special action and antitrust cards in one deck and the objective cards in another deck.
Put the common board, the money, the doors and the two decks (face down) within the reach of everyone. Put 1 score marker per player on the "0" position of the score track.
Separate the outdoor tiles from the indoor tiles, shuffle them. Make one face down pile for outdoor tiles and 2 face down piles per player for indoor tiles (with 3 players, you will make 6 piles). Turn face up the first tile of half the indoor piles.
Each player receives 1 objective card and takes money according to what is written on this objetive card. The objective card describes the house that must be built (how many rooms...).
Randomly choose the first player.
The game
The game is divided in turns.
Game turn
Starting with the first player, each player can take one "worker" action and one "free" action. When every worker is placed or when every player has passed, the turn ends.
The player then take their workers back, the first player changes (to the left) and the cards played during the turn are revealed face up.
Worker action
These actions require the player to use one of his workers. A player with no more workers cannot choose one of these actions.
Draw a tile
Draw 2 tiles from any pile, choose 1 of them and discard the other one in the discount. Put 1 worker on the pile you've drawn from. Now you have to pay the price of the choosen tile in order to put it on your individual board.
When you put a tile on your player board, if it is adjacent to another one, they must share a door. If they don't, you have to pay 1 extra [MONEY] to open a door. Put a door marker on the wall you want to open.
